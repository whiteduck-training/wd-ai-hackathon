      "User: My laptop keeps freezing when I open too many browser tabs\n",
      "Let's see if we can get that fixed for you. It sounds like your laptop may be running low on resources when you have multiple tabs open. We can try a few things to improve its performance.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Close Unnecessary Programs**: Make sure you only have programs running that you need. Each open program uses a portion of your computer's memory.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Task Manager**: \n",
      "   - On Windows, press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager.\n",
      "   - On Mac, use `Command + Space` to open Spotlight, then type `Activity Monitor` and press Enter.\n",
      "   - This will show you how much of your computer's resources (like memory and CPU) are being used.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Increase Virtual Memory** (Windows):\n",
      "   - Open `Control Panel` and go to `System and Security`, then `System`.\n",
      "   - Click on `Advanced system settings` and go to the `Advanced` tab.\n",
      "   - Under `Performance`, click `Settings`, then go to the `Advanced` tab and click `Change` under Virtual Memory.\n",
      "   - Increase the size of your paging file (this acts as extra RAM).\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Browser Extensions**: \n",
      "   - Disable any unnecessary browser extensions, as they can consume resources.\n",
      "   - To do this, go to your browser's settings and look for the section on extensions or add-ons.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Update Your Browser**: \n",
      "   - Make sure your browser is up-to-date, as updates often include performance improvements.\n",
      "   - Usually, you can find an update option in the browser menu under `Help` or `About`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Clear Cache**: \n",
      "   - Clearing your browser’s cache can also help speed things up.\n",
      "   - In most browsers, you can do this from the settings menu, under Privacy or History.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Add More RAM**: \n",
      "   - If after trying the above steps your laptop is still struggling, you might need more physical memory (RAM).\n",
      "   - Check with your laptop's manufacturer to see if this is possible, and consider getting more installed if needed.\n",

      "1. **Open Task Manager**:\n",
      "   - Press `Ctrl + Shift + Esc` to open Task Manager directly.\n",
      "   - Alternatively, you can right-click on the taskbar and select `Task Manager`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Memory Usage**:\n",
      "   - In Task Manager, click on the `Performance` tab.\n",
      "   - Select `Memory` from the left-hand menu.\n",
      "   - Here, you can see a graph of your RAM usage, along with details about how much memory is currently being used, how much is available, and the total amount installed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### On Mac:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Open Activity Monitor**:\n",
      "   - Use `Command + Space` to open Spotlight, then type `Activity Monitor` and press Enter.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Memory Usage**:\n",
      "   - In Activity Monitor, click on the `Memory` tab at the top.\n",
      "   - You will see a list of processes and how much memory each one is using.\n",
      "   - At the bottom of the window, you'll see a summary that includes your `Memory Used`, `Cached Files`, and the total amount of RAM installed.\n",
      "\n",
      "### On Linux:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Using System Monitor**:\n",
      "   - Open the System Monitor application. This can often be found in your applications menu under `System` or `Utilities`.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Check Memory Usage**:\n",
      "   - Navigate to the `Resources` tab.\n",
      "   - You’ll see a graphical representation of your current memory usage.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alternatively, you can use a terminal command:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Using `free` command**:\n",
      "   - Open a terminal.\n",
      "   - Type `free -h` and press Enter.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Timeframe for Requests**: Refund requests should be submitted within 30 days of the transaction date.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Processing Time**: Once approved, refunds are processed within 5-7 business days. However, it may take additional time for the refund to appear on your credit card or bank statement, depending on your financial institution.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Non-Refundable Charges**: Some fees, such as administrative fees or service fees, may be non-refundable. This will be clearly indicated at the time of the charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your situation fits these criteria, we can proceed with reviewing your specific charge. Would you like me to look into the unexpected charge on your statement now?\n",
